That dApp is based in a web browser that allow users play to "free games", why free games got that quotation marks,
because every time the user play to the game, a tx will be made, with that amount, the player will be able to play one time to 
the game.

That dapp incentives the decentralization of the games platforms, helping to games developers get some tips for their work,
as much addictive and better content, more tips and revenue will get the gamedeveloper

For now, we will do a mvp with one game, but the main idea is get a lot of developers upload their code to the platform and with
the help of the smartcontract get his tips.
